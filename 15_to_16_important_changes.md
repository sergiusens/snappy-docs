# Important System Changes
During the development of Series 16 there were several changes to environment in which apps are executed that you may need to be aware of.

## Environment Variables 
When a snap package is installed on to a system, a launcher script is created for each app that it declares in the directory `/snap/bin`. This is a snap specific location on the system `PATH`. This script is responsible for configuring the shell environment that apps will run in. A number of key variables have been re-named since 15.04:

15.04 | Series 16 | Description
---- | ---- | ----
SNAP_APP_PATH | SNAP | Name change - The directory where the snap is mounted
SNAP_APP_DATA_PATH | SNAP_DATA | Name change - A directory to store data or configuration needed whenever the an app from the snap is run. Write access would require root privileges.
SNAP_APP_TMPDIR | removed | 
SNAP_NAME | SNAP_NAME | No change - The package name
SNAP_VERSION | SNAP_VERSION | No change - The package version
SNAP_ORIGIN | removed
SNAP_FULLNAME | removed
SNAP_ARCH | SNAP_ARCH | No change - The target device CPU architecture
SNAP_APP_USER_DATA_PATH | SNAP_USER_DATA | Name change - A directory to store data or configuration specific to the user. Always writeable.
-  | SNAP_REVISION | New
-  | SNAP_LIBRARY_PATH  | New 

The snap `hello-world` provides a number of apps that are useful for experimenting with the environment that applications will run in. The launcher scripts can be examined to confirm the configuration.
