## Install snapcraft

`snapcraft` is the tool to create snaps. It's available on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS and above. To install it, simply run:

    sudo apt install snapcraft


## Build your first snap

A concise, step by step, snap example is the best way to get started! Head on to [Your first snap](/docs/build-snaps/your-first-snap).

### Automatically building from Git

You can set up your repository to automatically build and publish snaps using [these instructions](/docs/build-snaps/ci-integration).

### Building from Ubuntu 14.04 or another Linux distribution

If you're running the older Ubuntu 14.04 LTS or another Linux distribution, you can still build snaps using LXD or Docker. Just
follow [these instructions](/docs/build-snaps/trusty).

## Demos

The snapcraft source code provides snap demos for a [wide range of project types](https://github.com/snapcore/snapcraft/tree/master/demos).
