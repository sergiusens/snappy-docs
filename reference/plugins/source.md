Unless the part plugin overrides this behaviour, a part can use these
`source` keys in its definition. They tell snapcraft where to pull source
code for that part, and how to unpack it if necessary.

  - `source`: url-or-path

    A URL or path to some source tree to build. It can be local
    (`./src/foo`) or remote (`https://foo.org/...`), and can refer to a
    directory tree or a tarball or a revision control repository
    (`git:...`).

  - `source-type`: git, bzr, hg, svn, tar, or zip

    In some cases the source string is not enough to identify the version
    control system or compression algorithm. The source-type key can tell
    snapcraft exactly how to treat that content.

  - `source-depth`: `<integer>`

    By default clones or branches with full history, specifying a depth
    will truncate the history to the specified number of commits.

  - `source-branch`: `<branch-name>`

    Snapcraft will checkout a specific branch from the source tree. This
    only works on multi-branch repositories from git and hg (mercurial).

  - `source-commit`: `<commit>`

    Snapcraft will checkout the specific commit from the source tree revision
    control system.

  - `source-tag`: `<tag>`

    Snapcraft will checkout the specific tag from the source tree revision
    control system.

  - `source-subdir`: path

    Snapcraft will checkout the repository or unpack the archive referred to
    by the `source` keyword into `parts/<part-name>/src/` but it will only
    copy the specified subdirectory into `parts/<part-name>/build/`.

  - `source-checksum`: `<algorithm>/<checksum>`

    Snapcraft will use the checksum specified to verify the integrity of the
    source. The source-type of the source needs to be a file (`tar`, `zip`, `deb` or `rpm`)
    and the algorithm either `md5`, `sha1`, `sha224`, `sha256`, `sha384`, `sha512`, `sha3_256`,
    `sha3_384` or `sha3_512`. Prepend the checksum with its type, e.g. `sha256/<checksum>`.

Note that plugins might well define their own semantics for the `source`
keywords, because they handle specific build systems, and many languages
have their own built-in packaging systems (think CPAN, PyPI, NPM). In those
cases you want to refer to the help text for the specific plugin.
