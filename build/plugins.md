Title: Build Your Own Plugin	
# Build Your Own Plugin

Plugins are pieces of Python code that tell Snapcraft how to build the content of a snap's parts. There are a variety of plugins already included with snapcraft. You can find the current list from `$ snapcraft list-plugins`, and you should find plugins covering Python 2 and 3, Go, Java, cmake- and autotools-based projects, and more. These supplied plugins will usually be adequate for building most snaps. 

However, you can add your own plugins for other languages. 

## Adding plugins

To illustrate how a plugin is created, consider adding support for a custom build-tool named “Crafty”. The goal of this plugin is to pass a configurable target to the `crafty sometarget` command inside the `src/crafty` source directory. 

Relative to the directory of `snapcraft.yaml`, create `parts/plugins/x-crafty.yaml` containing:

      options:
          source:
              required: true
          source-type:
          source-tag:
          source-branch:
          crafty-target:
              required: true

and `parts/plugins/x_crafty.py` containing:

    import snapcraft
    
    class XCraftyPlugin(snapcraft.BasePlugin):
        def build(self):
            return self.run([‘crafty’, self.options.crafty_target])
    
        def pull(self):
            return self.handle_source_options()

Note that to avoid collisions with official part plugins, the names are prefixed with “x”:  `x_crafty`, and `x-crafty`.

This part plugin is then used in `snapcraft.yaml` with:

    parts:
      crafted-bits:
        plugin: x-crafty
        source: src/crafty
        crafty-target: sometarget

New part plugins are typically placed in the snap’s source directory along `snapcraft.yaml` as they mature, then submitted as patches to the Snapcraft project for everyone to use.

## Examples
If you would like to explore plugins further, here are a couple of plugin examples and basic building details:

### autoconf-make: The standard "configure, make, make install" plugin

    $ snapcraft help autotools
    $ snapcraft help make

#### golang: The Golang plugin

See [https://github.com/ubuntu-core/snapcraft/blob/master/demos/godd/snapcraft.yaml](https://github.com/ubuntu-core/snapcraft/blob/master/demos/godd/snapcraft.yaml)
