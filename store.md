# Ubuntu Store

Snaps are distributed to snappy devices through [the Ubuntu Store](https://myapps.developer.ubuntu.com/dev/click-apps/ "Ubuntu store"), where you can customize how your snap is presented, review each new upload, and control publishing.

You'll choose a unique developer namespace as part of the account creation process. 

Uploading snaps to the store can be done directly from the [snapcraft](snapcraft_intro.md "snapcraft upload") tool. Once uploaded you choose the [channel](channels.md "channels") that the snap will be published to (the upload command returns the URL of the page you need to visit to do this). Once you've chosen a channel and clicked **Publish**, the snap be available to users.

It's also worth noting that the store automatically gives your snap a new revision number when you publish it.

You can publish a snap under any name you have rights to and you can registered a name by clicking **New Snap** on the developer portal, or by visiting the [Register name](https://myapps.developer.ubuntu.com/dev/click-apps/register-name/ "register name") page. You can also provide other developers with permission to publish versions of the snap, for example as part of an open source project.
